## Context

This application is a group project of the first Module of Turing School of Software and Design. As a team we completed this application during the course of 8 days. We built out the HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch. This application also required technical knowledge of the data model, DOM manipulation, CSS responsive layouts and local storage.

The Intention Timer aims to set goals for healthy and productive activities including studying, meditating and exercising. The user can choose from this activities and input their intention and amount of time. This information the can be stored and display so that the user can look at their past activities.

### Technologies used:

 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 * Git
 * GitHub
 * Media queries


## Challenges

  * Separating the data model and DOM manipulation using JavaScript classes
  * Git workflow while working as a team with multiple contributors
  * Writing DRY JavaScript  

## Wins

  * Timer functionality
  * Event listeners
